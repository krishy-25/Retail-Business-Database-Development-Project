# Retail Business SQL Implementation

## Overview
This repository showcases my SQL implementation for a comprehensive database project focused on a retail business management system. The project was part of the database systems course and features SQL queries designed to answer business questions and support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Context
This repository includes the SQL implementation aspect of a larger database project, which involved:

- **ER Modeling**: Designed an entity-relationship diagram to map out relationships among key business entities like customers, employees, products, and purchases.
- **Relational Schema Design**: Translated the ER model into normalized relational tables to maintain data consistency.
- **Normalization**: Applied 3NF and BCNF principles to optimize the schema structure for data integrity and to minimize redundancy.

*Note: The ER modeling, schema design, and normalization documents are not included here, but they were important in guiding the development of an optimized database structure.*

## SQL Implementation
This repository includes:
- **Database Creation Script**: SQL script for constructing and populating relational tables with real-world data.
- **SQL Queries**: SQL queries that showcase my ability in handling data operations such as complex joins, subqueries, data aggregation, and formatting.
- **Results Overview**: A document explaining the logic and outcomes of each query.

## Key Highlights
- **SQL Queries**: Developed a range of queries to handle data requirements, such as extracting customer purchase patterns and summarizing sales data over time. 
- **Techniques**: Used subqueries, conditional logic, and data formatting to create precise reports and answer specific business questions.
- **Real-World Problem Solving**: Addressed practical scenarios, including finding high-value customers, analyzing product performance, and generating reports on customer visit frequency and spending trends.
